# Docker Management System (DMS)

The docker management system (affectionately called _Dockernetes_, no relation 
to Lyft's Dockernetes), is a container management system devoted to making
Docker deployments as easy and as painless as possible. 

This project is open source, and free. It is also open to contributions. 

## Installation

**Warning: Everything in this repo is subject to change without notice. DMS
is still in its very early stages of development and should be loaded with care.**

There are no releases at this time, so you're going to have to clone the repo.

### With Minikube

With Minikube enabled, run the following command:

```shell
minikube apply -f deployment
```

This will deploy DMS to your local k8s cluster.

### With EKS

***This is still in development, and we will revisit this soon. Thanks for 
the wait.***
